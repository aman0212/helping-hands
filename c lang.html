    <pr>If you really want to learn programming then do attempt C programs before watching its solution. Do not give up too early, give time to yourself. When program is developed, you should dry run it to check its correctness. Now type the code in the editor, compile and run it. Hopefully outcome is no different from what you were expecting, otherwise your dry run was not done in proper manner. Finding mistakes in your program by yourself without compiling it is very important in skill development.
